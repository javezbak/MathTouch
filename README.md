# MathTouch

### Presented by Yichen Gong, Rayan Tejuja, Jonathan Avezbaki and Diana Guzman

MathTouch is a project aims to provide visually impaired people with equal opportunity to learn math. To do so, we build an application, a server service and a hardware to convert handwritten equation to sensible braille display. Therefore, the instructor can write math equation on the Tablet and the visually impaired student can learn from touch in real time. 



Here is the structure of the code

* BrailleCells: the relevant Arduino code
* Correct Certificate: The certificate used to power Myscript API
* IInkUIReferenceImplementation: The Myscript Interactive-Ink SDK static package
* latex_to_binary: The latex to binary braille representation conversion system, the service is hosted on AWS
* Logos: A set of logo we use in this project
* MathTouchUnified: The complete iOS app for this project.
